   * TODO: create a new Dog Object, and use the addDog method provided in the DogsService to add the new dog.
   *
   * Firstly, you need to understand how to create an object based off of an interface. Using an interface instead of a
   * class to model data is accepted and common in Angular development. The general concept of an interface being a
   * 'contractual guarantee of behavior' still applies.
   *
   * the syntax would look a bit like this:
   * let objName : interfaceName = {stringField: "value1", numberField: 123};
   * in your case, you should use the this.nameInput, this.breedInput, this.ageInput fields rather than "value1" and 123
   * to create the new Dog based off the Dog interface. After creating the new Object (let's say it's called newDog),
   * you should call the dogsService.addDog(newDog); method.
